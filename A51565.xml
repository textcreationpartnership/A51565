            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> are wont to glory in their
<pb facs="tcp:110244:3"/>Profeſſion, as ſtanding not in Word, but in Power: Whereby they ſeem to mean the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Converſation of their People above all others: But if particular Perſons among them tranſgreſs ſo manifeſtly, that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; then they defend themſelves, as others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o, by ſaying, That it is no fault of their Principles, but the Perſon, that did not walk according to his Principles; But if it do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as here it doth, that not only as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, but as a Body, they are guilty of the like Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as other faulty Bodies or Corporations, I hope we ſhall not ſuffer our ſelves to be impoſed upon by their nauſeous Self-commendations, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they tranſcend all others, or that their Principles are better than thoſe of other Chriſtians whom they condemn, at leaſt it will not appear from their Practices that they are ſo.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs ſay, I ſee no reaſon at all, why the Writings of particular Perſons, that are of the greateſt Eminency among them, who write in their Names, and are generally, if not univerſally, approved by them, as written by their true Spirit, ſhould not be imputed to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as <hi>Quakers;</hi> But that what they
<pb facs="tcp:110244:4"/>do as a Body and Society ſhould reflect upon them as ſuch, I cannot ſee with what face they can deny.</p>
            <p>I do indeed eaſily foreſee, they will endeavour to invalidate the Evidence that is here given againſt them, from the want of the Author's Name: To which Exception I have this to ſay to the Judicious Reader;</p>

            <p>It pleaſed the Lord, about twenty Years ago, to viſit this Nation with his Loving-kindneſs, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a Spiritual-Miniſtry, in the mid'ſt of Wars and Fightings, to turn us from Darkneſs to Light, and to bring us out of the Strife into the Patience of Jeſus, into his Love and Meekneſs, to do good for evil.</p>
            <p>This Seed being ſown, proſpered in the Hearts of many, and brought forth Victory through Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Spirit of Burning: And the Lord was wonderfully with them in this Diſpenſation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110244:6"/>that very many came off from the barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and out of the ſandy Deſerts, and were here refreſhed, without Money, without Price, and the Bread was broken freely to the Hungry, and Water given freely to the Thirſty: And not only ſo, but likewiſe our Veſſels were filled with the ſame, whereby our Hearts were made glad, and cauſed the Springs of Life to break forth out of our Bellies, and the Bread of Life to dwell within us that we needed not to go forth out of our own Houſes, having an Holy Anointing within us to ſupply the wants of our Souls, and lead us into a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And the Lord did daily add unto the Church, and raiſed up many to go forth in the Power to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, whereby the Church multiply'd and encreaſed to the aſtoniſhment of the Nations.</p>

            <p>This combined Unity I have no pleaſure in; its Nature is known by its Image, its Birth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of its Power.</p>
            <p>My Friend Obſerve; What difference is there in theſe things between <hi>George Fox</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> The one ſaith, <hi>No Liberty out of the Church:</hi> The other, <hi>No Liberty out of the Power.</hi> Saith the <hi>Papiſt, What Liberty to the Sectary?</hi> No: <hi>What Liberty to the Heretick?</hi> No. And <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaith, <hi>What Liberty to the Presbyter?</hi> No: <hi>What Liberty to the Independant?</hi> No: <hi>What Liberty to the Baptiſt?</hi> No. <hi>Liberty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in the Truth.</hi> The difference lies only here, The one hath greater Power to compel than the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>Believe as the Church Believes:</hi> So likewiſe ſaith <hi>G.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> am to wait till God Reveals it. I was told the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid by two there preſent.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> claims a Power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication (of them) that will not ſubmit to their decent and comely Order, though in it ſelf the thing be meerly Circumſtantial, Ceremonial, or (as they term it) indifferent; and their reaſon is, It Judgeth the Power, and ſmites at the Authority, and (ſay they) it's an Inlet to Diviſion and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is Unity violated.</p>
            <p>Behold a reſemblance thereof, it hath been often
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110244:7"/>ſaid unto me, The <hi>Hat</hi> is nothing, but it is out of the comely Order, it judgeth Friends, who are in the Power, who teſtifie againſt it, and it breaks the Unity; and therefore we cannot ſuffer ſuch to Marry or Bury, nor to partake of any Priviledge as a Member of the Body; and this is in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Excommunication: For Excommunication chiefly lies in a Man's being deprived of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and put out of the Protection of the Law, as alſo from being a Member of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Severity is the ſame with us, for where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould I Marry or Bury, if we were an intire Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or how can I take a Wife without a Witneſs? Or how can I have a Witneſs, if to be one is lyable to the ſame Miſery.</p>
            <p>Selected Bodies ought to be found in the Exerciſe of Moderation, Tenderneſs, and Mercy, as if they were a Nation. I always find, when once ſuch put forth their Hands to afflict for Conſcience ſake, as their Power groweth ſtrong, ſo doth their Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>But perhaps they would ſay, We do not eject for Conſcience ſake, but becauſe of an obſtinate Will, which oppoſeth Friends.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> juſtifie themſelves by ſaying of the ſame. I remember a Judge likewiſe made the ſame reply when a Friend mentioned Conſcience. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot be an Evil in one, and Right in the other, no more than it is Cruelty in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Perſecutions, and Juſt in the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be a noble Example in thoſe that ſtand upon the Advantage-ground to Act in Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Tenderneſs and Mercy. And although it is the Policy of the World's Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110244:8"/>pretence for Unity, not to hear the tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet the Church of Truth will; and where they are found, will account them as Brethren, and not to think it a ſufficient ground to refuſe them after Admonition, if they perſiſt, but to wait till God perſwades them. And this is the Royal Law of Liberty, the other is the Yoke of Bondage, from which we are not to be entangled after the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men.</p>
            <p>This great Charter of Liberty is violated, and greatly broken in many particulars: If I have a Cauſe before the Elders, but eſpecially if I am a Diſſenter, it's frequently urg'd, give it to Friends; if I do not, a farther Snare is offered, namely; <hi>Doſt thou believe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to be in the Power of God?</hi> If I ſay, Yea; then, <hi>What wilt thou not leave it to the Power of God in Friends? Thou art in confuſion to believe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to be in the Power, and yet durſt not truſt to the Judgment of the Power.</hi> To my knowledge, this is a capital Crime accounted.</p>
            <p>What greater Uſurpation can there be than this, to claim my Right from me into their Breaſts? For though the Elders may be preſerved in the Power this Year or Seaſon, they may apoſtatize from the Truth, and yet claim the ſame Prerogative over my Propriety; hereby a Tyranny may be entail'd upon my ſelf, by laying of ſuch a Foundation.</p>
            <p>A moſt incomparable Inſtance is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was in the Power and Glory of God; howbeit through Pride ſhe loſt it, yet gain'd, through Subtilty, the Prerogative before mentioned, to give up unto her Judgment, and to believe as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, to the Deſtruction of many thouſands: So that it clearly appears, the Spirit that claims ſuch a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110244:8"/>Power, under pretence of being in the Power, is the Spirit of Exaltation: and I know, that thoſe Perſons that have been moſt confident in the claim, under the ſame pretence, have committed great miſtakes; and thereby Truth hath been depreſſed, and Error cheriſhed.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe I may affirm that in all Ages, Truth hath not been perſecuted as Truth, but as Error; I could inſtance, that many in the great Aſſemblies in <hi>London,</hi> have not only been diſſatisfied with the reſt of their Brethrens Actings, though they made uſe of the Name of the Lord. Both theſe cannot be right, yet both claim the ſame Power in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Otherwhiles ſubmit (through fear) unto the Judgment of the more eminent, though it doth not at all correſpond with their underſtandings. If one part of the Body be liable to miſtakes, why not the other? And if the Spirit, as they are a Body, is to be Judge and Determiner of Things; by what Spirit ſhall I know which is in the right? How needful is it therefore to be joyned to our own, in the particular, conſidering how lyable man is to err; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is concerning the Marriage of <hi>John Oſgood,</hi> who is well known to be a man of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Sobriety, and of a deep Judgment, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and holding forth, as occaſion offered, the Principles delivered; and he was held in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that I know no mans Counſel had a greater influence upon, and acceptance with the Meeting than his; But after he came to forbear the Exerciſe of the <hi>Hat</hi> in Prayer: The Zealots for that practice, did uſe their utmoſt endeavour to ſcrew him out of that power and authority which he had in the Meeting, as the Paper ſigned by <hi>Eleven</hi> Miniſters doth clearly demonſtrate. It came to paſs, that it was his purpoſe to take <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca Travers,</hi> the Younger, to be his Wife: firſt lie went to the <hi>Womans</hi>-Meeting, according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, to acquaint them with his Intentions, and there they paſt it with ſo great an Acceptation, that a very conſiderable part of them went along with him to the Mens-Meeting, to juſtifie and ſtand to their procedure towards him, if occaſion offered, whereas others have ſeldom above two. He liked wiſe acquainted the Men with it, and after a ſhort ſpace, one there charged him for oppoſing a Serval
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110244:16"/>of the Lord, that had declared a thing in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>He preſently cleared himſelf from this aſperſion, by proving the perſon to be in a notorious falſity, which he aſſerted in the Name of the Lord; this Blaſphemer, that is thus ſtiled the Servant of the Lord, under the pretence of a Phyſician or Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, made it his common practice to commit Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and wantonneſs towards Women; and yet he was employed and ſent by <hi>G. F.</hi> to judge Perſons and Meetings; he made him alſo as his Companion in his Travels, and covered him in his wickedneſs, inſomuch that it was a crime ſufficient to take notice thereof.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>John Oſgood</hi> cleared himſelf as is above expreſſed, <hi>John Bolton</hi> with two or three more had another ſnare for him; namely, <hi>Wilt thou give a teſtimony againſt the Hat-ſpirit?</hi> His Reply was to this purpoſe, <hi>When he ſaw it to be an evil, he ſhould; but at the preſent he did not, and therefore could not give a Teſtimony againſt a thing, before it was manifeſted in him to be an Evil.</hi> This would not ſatisfie them, altho' he again came into their practice, in the keeping of it off. This Marriage was declared by <hi>Rebecca Travers</hi> the Elder, and <hi>J. O.</hi> to be of the Lord: and <hi>John Bolton,</hi> with not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
